flu     sore   throat  n  runny   nose
My eyes are puffy My  nose  is  runny  and blocked My ears are ringing My  throat  is scratchy  Wow this is what death must feel like 
A  fever ,  runny   nose ,  sore   throat  is a good way to start my Thursday. Plus I slept about 3 hours..good stuff. I wish I could just take a day off.
If I die on the runway then that's where I fucking die. I've worked too hard to have something as stupid as a  sore   throat ,  runny   nose , and no sleep ruin this.
Flu  is fine but not  sore   throat  and itchy  nose . Shoot me already.
Yassss Mr URTI is here.  I can feel it tickling in my  nose  and poking needles in my  throat .   I'm expecting Mr  Fever  to bust open the door and start the party anytime, now.   Good start to weekend.
If I take cough suppressors, there is a free flow of thin mucous that runs out of my  nose  and clogs my sinus.  If I don't take the cough suppressors, I end up  coughing  till my  throat  hurts and thick bloodstained phlegm come out.  There is no win here.

If you have some honey, take a spoonful. It'll coat your  throat ! If that doesn't work, gurgle some salt water  If you have ginger ale/mint tea, that's good for an upset stomach! As for the  runny   nose , cold medicine would be a good place to start   I hope you feel better :c

Bring on the  sore   throat  and  runny   nose ....
Itchy watery eyes, snotty  nose ,  sore   throat ,  headache . I am feeling miserable. If I could just rip my head off during this season that would be amazing.
My  nose  has been so  stuffed  and my  throat  hurts and I have a  headache . I've been eating so much spicy food hoping it'll clear things up 
Also can't tell if I'm getting better or worse. The cough and  sore   throat  are gone but  runny   nose  and mild fevers still around 
day 967. still sick. i have lost my sense of smell and taste. i can no longer breathe from my  nose .  throat  swollen from  coughing . talking has become difficult.
How do I know if I've got a cold or hay  fever ? Never had hay  fever  before. Have swollen  throat , cough,  runny   nose , woolly head
My allergies are kicking my butt... literally I might tweet this everyday because my eyes burn, my  nose  feels like it's going to bleed, I keep  sneezing , my  throat  itches constantly, and my ears itch too 
okay so my  throat  barely hurts and my  nose  is a bit  runny  but i feel like dying

I can FEEL the pollen in the air, hayfever has begun, I was complaining about the cold, but I take it all back, I'd rather freeze to death than suffer these allergies, its the eyes that does it, I can take the  sore   throat , the blocked  nose , the  sneezing , just not the eyes.
