Listen guys. You are not too manly to wear a scarf over your face in these frigid temps. It will freeze the moisture in  throat / nose  in minutes. Then you will be stuffy with sinus  headache  and will open gates to every virus. Then can spread thru whole family. Man up and scarf up.

In conclusion, I am not a cowgirl, I probably couldve used a farmer man, and I have possibly contracted the  flu  in the process considering Im under strict orders to stay out of the cold due to a  sore   throat , cough, and  runny   nose . I officially give up on saving animals
i dont believe it is, i feel fine other than my  throat  and  nose , no  fever  or headaches

Woke up sick as shit this morning.  Sore   throat ,  runny   nose , tiredness, the works. Don't have the PTO to cover an unexpected day off. Sick is sick tho and I don't want to risk infecting anyone else.
I dont mind having  fever  and  sore   throat  but having  runny   nose  w constant  sneezing  sucks and not fun!
Normal rule of thumb is any symptoms neck and below neck = don't run so ok to run if  runny  or bunged  nose  etc but don't run if  throat  is  sore  or chest problems. Not an exact science, if you do run with a cold then it should only be to maintain fitness not progress it until well.
Okay I might have spoken too soon. Im having the  flu  and tonsillitis and most probably a  fever  soon. My  nose s all blocked and hurt and my  throat s all swollen and  sore .
